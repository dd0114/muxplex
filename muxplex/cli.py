    this guard the new process fails to bind, exits with status=1, and systemd
    restarts it in an infinite loop (observed: 2075+ restarts before manual
    intervention).

    The original implementation killed *whatever* held the port, which meant a
    stray invocation of the startup path would silently terminate a healthy,
    serving muxplex.  Now the holder is probed first
    (:func:`_port_holder_is_healthy_muxplex`) and killed ONLY on positive
    evidence that it is not serving.  If it *is* serving, this raises
    ``SystemExit(1)`` with an actionable message instead of starting.

    Restart-race reasoning: during a legitimate ``systemctl restart``, systemd
    waits for the old process to exit before starting the new one, so normally no
    holder exists and the probe never runs.  If an old instance is still draining
    and answers the probe, the new process exits non-zero and systemd retries
    after ``RestartSec`` -- a bounded retry that resolves as soon as the old
    instance finishes draining.  That is strictly better than killing a healthy
    server, and cannot become a tight loop because each attempt costs a full
    ``RestartSec`` delay.

    """Print a shell-eval-able TMUX_TMPDIR export for THIS muxplex instance.

    Designed for `eval "$(muxplex env)"` (the ssh-agent/direnv convention).
    Prints ONLY the export line to stdout -- no banners, no extra output --
    so `eval` is always safe. Any human-facing notes go to stderr.

    Why this exists: muxplex looks for tmux sessions under a specific
    socket directory (`tmux_socket_dir` setting, mapped to tmux's
    TMUX_TMPDIR env var). Any OTHER tool that creates a tmux session
    without setting the same TMUX_TMPDIR lands on a DIFFERENT tmux server
    and is silently invisible to this muxplex instance -- see AGENTS.md's
    "tmux socket" section and settings.py's tmux_socket_dir comment. Running
    `eval "$(muxplex env)"` before creating a session is the one-line fix.

    Best-effort resolution: this CLI process's own environment is not
    necessarily the same as the running muxplex *service* process's
    environment (a systemd/launchd unit's env commonly differs from an
    interactive shell's). When `tmux_socket_dir` is explicitly configured
    in settings.json, that value is authoritative and this caveat doesn't
    apply. When it's unset, the printed value is inferred from this
    process's own TMUX_TMPDIR (or tmux's compiled-in default) and may not
    exactly match what the service resolves -- see
    settings.resolve_tmux_socket_dir()'s docstring for the full precedence.
