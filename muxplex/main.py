    """Return the server-resolved current view: filtered, sorted sessions
    plus view metadata.

    This is the canonical home for view-resolution semantics that the PWA,
    muxplex-deck, and future agent clients would otherwise each have to
    re-implement: `filter_visible` membership/hidden rules, the
    needs-attention bell predicate, and sort ordering. See AGENTS.md
    "Semantics external clients re-implement" for the rationale; new
    clients should prefer this endpoint over re-deriving these rules.

    Query params:
        sort: omitted -> honor `settings.sort_order` the same way the PWA
            does today (`"alphabetical"` sorts by name; any other value
            preserves /api/sessions enumeration order, reported back as
            `"server"`). `"attention"` requests tiered ordering: sessions
            needing attention first (freshest bell first), then the active
            session (if not already surfaced), then the rest ordered by
            last_activity_at descending (unknown activity sorts last). Any
            other value is rejected with 400 -- no silent fallback.

    Response shape:
        {
          "view": <active_view, echoed verbatim>,
          "views": ["all", <user view names, settings order>],
          "sort": "server" | "alphabetical" | "attention",

            {"name", "active", "needs_attention", "bell", "last_activity_at"}
          ],
        }

    `views` deliberately excludes "hidden": it remains addressable as an
    active_view value (GET /api/state, PATCH /api/state), but it is not a
    browsable/cyclable view alongside "all" and user-defined views.

    Deliberately light: no pane snapshots here (those stay on
    GET /api/sessions) so this endpoint stays cheap for frequent polling
    (e.g. a Stream Deck dial).

    Scope: local sessions only. Unlike GET /api/federation/sessions, this
    answers "what does *this* device's current view look like" -- remote
    peers are not merged in. The shape is additive, so a federated variant
    can be added later without changing it.

    An unknown/deleted active_view is not an error: `sessions` comes back
    empty while `view` still echoes the (now unresolvable) name, matching
    current PWA behavior for this case.

    The response is redacted in the same way as ``GET /api/settings`` so that

    Optimistic concurrency (compare-and-swap): the body MAY include an
    ``expected_settings_updated_at`` float. When present, it must equal the
    server's CURRENT ``settings_updated_at`` or the request is rejected with
    409 and NO write is made. This closes the clobber hazard where a client
    holding a stale in-memory settings snapshot (e.g. an old copy of the
    entire ``views`` array) builds a patch from that stale data and
    overwrites a concurrent edit made by another device/tab -- this is
    exactly how a real incident destroyed 7 of 8 views in one request.
    When omitted, behavior is unchanged (backward compatible with existing
    clients, including federation sync, which don't send it yet). New
    clients SHOULD send it -- see frontend/app.js's ``patchSettingsGuarded``
    for the reference implementation.

    The precondition field is popped out of the body before it reaches
    ``patch_settings()`` -- it's a precondition, not a setting, and isn't a
    key ``patch_settings`` would recognize anyway (it's not in
    DEFAULT_SETTINGS), but popping it explicitly documents the intent and
    avoids depending on that incidental behavior.

    NOTE: there's no Pydantic model backing this endpoint's body today (it
    reads raw JSON because the patch is an open-ended subset of
    DEFAULT_SETTINGS keys) -- this field is handled the same way, as a
    plain dict key, rather than introducing a new model just for one field.

    Destructive-write backstop: independent of the CAS precondition above,
    any patch containing ``views`` is assessed for catastrophic shrinkage
    (see ``views.assess_views_destruction`` / ``settings.patch_settings``).
    A catastrophic write is rejected with 409 -- ``{"detail": <reason>,
    "settings_updated_at": <current>, "backstop": true, "counts": {...}}``
    -- and NO write is made, regardless of whether the CAS precondition
    passed. This is a SEPARATE 409 cause from the CAS mismatch above; the
    response body's ``backstop: true`` field is how a client distinguishes
    them (a CAS 409 means "reload and retry your intent"; a backstop 409
    means "this intent itself is destructive -- do not blindly retry it").
    Pass ``allow_destructive: true`` in the body (also popped before

    Only after ttyd is confirmed reachable does the function call
    websocket.accept() — so the browser's 'open' event only fires once a real
    relay is possible.  This prevents the reconnect-counter bounce bug where
    the proxy accepted immediately (resetting _reconnectAttempts to 0) and
    then closed as soon as it couldn't reach the dead ttyd.

    The ttyd auto-spawn wait (kill_ttyd + spawn_ttyd + a fixed 0.8s settle
    delay) is real wall-clock time during which the browser can disconnect
    (tab closed, navigation, network drop, PWA backgrounding). Calling
    websocket.accept() after that happens raises RuntimeError — see
    _client_disconnected()'s docstring for the exact mechanism — so that wait
    is raced against a disconnect watcher and accept() is skipped entirely if
    the client is already gone.
