"""
tmux session enumeration and snapshot helpers for the tmux-web muxplex.

In-memory cache:
    _session_list  — most-recently-enumerated list of session names.
    _snapshots     — most-recently-captured pane text, keyed by session name.
    _activity      — most-recently-enumerated last-output-activity timestamp
                     (unix epoch seconds), keyed by session name.

Public API:
    get_session_list()                    → list[str]
    get_snapshots()                       → dict[str, str]
    get_session_activity()                → dict[str, float]
    update_session_cache(names, snapshots) → None
    run_tmux(*args)                       → str   (raises RuntimeError on nonzero exit)
    enumerate_sessions()                  → list[str]
    capture_pane(name, lines)             → str
    snapshot_all(names)                   → dict[str, str]

Note on _activity: unlike _session_list/_snapshots (which are only ever
swapped together, atomically, via update_session_cache), _activity is
populated directly by enumerate_sessions() as a side effect of parsing
tmux's output. It comes from the exact same `tmux list-sessions` call that
produces the name list, so there's no second subprocess round trip and no
consistency dependency on the (separately captured) pane snapshots. Each
call fully replaces _activity, so entries for sessions that have since
closed are dropped on the next poll, same as the other caches.

Why `#{window_activity}` and not `#{session_activity}`: tmux's session-level
`session_activity` only advances when a *client is attached* to the session
(verified empirically: sending real output to a headless, never-attached
session left `session_activity` frozen at its creation time indefinitely,
while `window_activity` advanced immediately). Since muxplex's whole point
is surfacing sessions producing output *unattended* -- e.g. a build running
in a session nobody has open in a browser tab right now -- `session_activity`
would silently fail to track exactly the sessions this feature most needs to
surface. `window_activity` tracks real pane output regardless of client
attachment. It resolves correctly (matching `list-windows -a` for the same
window) when queried in a `list-sessions -F` context, which implicitly
selects each session's active window -- consistent with capture_pane()
elsewhere in this module, which likewise only ever looks at a session's
active window/pane.

# Session-name validation (security boundary)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Canonical allowlist for client-supplied session names. A name that matches
# this pattern contains no shell metacharacters, whitespace, or the tmux target
# separator (`:`), so it is safe to substitute into a shell template
# (create/delete session commands) and safe as a `tmux -t` target.
#
# This is the PRIMARY defense against shell injection via session names. Every
# API endpoint that accepts a client-supplied session name and forwards it to a
# subprocess (create, delete, connect, and any future input endpoint) MUST run
# the name through `is_valid_session_name()` at the boundary, BEFORE any
# substitution or subprocess call.
#
# Charset rationale: tmux forbids `:` in session names (it's the
# session:window.pane target separator), so excluding it costs nothing. All 68
# of the deployment's live session names pass this pattern; it does not reject
# any legitimate existing name.
# The first character MUST be alphanumeric or underscore. This is deliberate and
# security-load-bearing: a leading ``-`` would let a valid name be parsed as an
# OPTION by tmux or by a user-configurable template command (argument injection),
# and ``shlex.quote`` does NOT neutralize that -- quoting stops shell-metacharacter
# interpretation, but a quoted ``-C`` or ``--destroy`` is still a flag to the
# invoked program. Forbidding a leading ``-`` (and leading ``.``/``..`` path
# traversal) closes that class. ``\A...\Z`` (not ``^...$``) is required because
# ``$`` also matches just before a trailing newline, so ``"name\n"`` would slip
# through ``^...$``. All 68 live session names pass this pattern.

    A systemd/launchd service does NOT inherit the user's interactive login
    shell environment. If the user sets TMUX_TMPDIR in their shell rc (common
    when keeping sockets out of the shared, world-writable /tmp), the muxplex
    *service* process never sees it -- tmux silently falls back to its
    compiled-in default (/tmp/tmux-$UID) and every real session becomes
    invisible to muxplex, even though `tmux list-sessions` works fine when
    run interactively by the same user.

    Returns:
        None if `tmux_socket_dir` is unset/empty -- callers should pass

        Also removes `TMUX` from the returned environment. tmux gives `$TMUX`

        priority over `TMUX_TMPDIR` when resolving which server socket to

        override and keep talking to that other server. The muxplex *service*
        itself is never an attached tmux client, so this is a no-op in the
