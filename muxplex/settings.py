    """Apply synced settings from a remote server.

    Only applies keys that are in SYNCABLE_KEYS. Sets settings_updated_at
    to the incoming timestamp (NOT time.time()) to prevent sync loops.

    `_schema_version` is intentionally **never** accepted from the wire.
    Each device speaks for its own schema version; receiving a peer's version
    must not downgrade ours. The peer's version is observable on the incoming
    payload (use `peer_supports_v2()`) before this function applies anything.

    After applying synced keys, enforces the mutual exclusion invariant:
    any session key that appears in both hidden_sessions and a view's sessions
    is removed from hidden_sessions (visibility wins over hiding).

    Destructive-write backstop: whenever `views` or `hidden_sessions` is about
    to be applied, the incoming `views` is assessed via
    `views.assess_views_destruction` against the CURRENT on-disk `views`. A
    catastrophic shrinkage raises `DestructiveSettingsWriteRejected` and makes
    NO write at all. Unlike patch_settings(), there is no override here --
    federation sync NEVER gets `allow_destructive`. Rationale: a peer must
    never be able to force a destructive change onto another device just by
    sending the right flag; only a local operator editing settings.json
    directly can perform an intentional bulk deletion that a peer disagrees
    with.

    views-specific conflict resolution (`views_updated_at`): `views` and
    `hidden_sessions` are gated by `incoming_views_updated_at`, NOT by the
    overall `incoming_timestamp`/settings_updated_at LWW comparison the
    caller used to decide whether to invoke this function at all. This
    closes the race where an unrelated field (e.g. fontSize) bumped a peer's
    settings_updated_at more recently than a genuine views edit, letting the
    peer's stale views win a sync purely because the BLOB looked newer. If
    `incoming_views_updated_at` is strictly newer than our local
    `views_updated_at`, the incoming views/hidden_sessions are applied
    (subject to the backstop above); otherwise they are left untouched and
    every OTHER present key is still applied normally (the overall sync is
    not all-or-nothing).

    Backward compatibility: `incoming_views_updated_at=None` (the default)
    means the peer doesn't know about this field -- e.g. a pre-this-feature
    muxplex instance. In that case views/hidden_sessions are applied
    unconditionally (gated only by the backstop, never by a per-field
    timestamp), which is exactly the pre-existing behavior, so older peers
    keep interoperating without any change on their end.
