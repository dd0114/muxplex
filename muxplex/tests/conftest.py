"""Safety rails for the muxplex test suite.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS -- do not delete it, and do not weaken the guard:

On 2026-07-25 this suite was run repeatedly on a developer host that was also
running a live muxplex instance. It caused real production damage, twice over:

  1. A test that wrote settings without redirecting ``SETTINGS_PATH`` overwrote
     the host's real ``~/.config/muxplex/settings.json``, replacing an 8-view
     production configuration with its own fixture data
     (``{"name": "Focus", "sessions": ["alpha"]}``). Recovered from backups.

  2. Six tests called the real ``serve()`` without mocking
     ``_kill_stale_port_holder`` and without pinning a port. The port therefore
     resolved to ``DEFAULT_SETTINGS["port"]`` (8088), and the real killer ran
     ``lsof -ti :8088``, found the live server's PID, and SIGTERMed it. systemd
     restarted it each time, so the symptom was a server that "kept resetting"
     with clean graceful shutdowns, no crash, and no systemd ``Stopping`` line
     -- almost impossible to diagnose from the logs alone.

Neither failure was noticed for hours, because from inside the suite everything
looked green. That is the point: a test that damages its host still passes.

The guard below makes the whole class fail LOUD and up front instead. It is a
mechanism, not a reminder -- a future session with none of this context still
gets stopped. ``test_safety_rails.py`` fails if this file or its guard goes
missing, so removing it cannot pass silently either.

The correct way to run this suite is inside an isolated environment (a Digital
Twin Universe container). See ``AGENTS.md`` -> "Running the test suite".

    with an env var; the settings isolation does not help here, because the
    port still resolves to ``DEFAULT_SETTINGS["port"]`` when a test calls
    ``serve()`` without pinning one. That is exactly how six tests in
    ``test_cli.py`` came to run ``lsof -ti :8088`` against a developer's live
    server and SIGTERM it.
