"""
Views invariant enforcement, visibility filtering, validation, and stale-key
pruning for muxplex.

Schema v2 semantics (see docs/plans/2026-05-17-hidden-state-redesign-design.md):
- "hidden" is a property of a session, determined by membership in
  hidden_sessions. View membership and hidden state are orthogonal.
- A session key MAY appear in both hidden_sessions and one or more
  view.sessions. Lists are filtered at read time via `filter_visible`.
- The legacy mutual-exclusion invariant (`enforce_mutual_exclusion`) is
  retained as a backstop in v1 for mixed-version federation compatibility.
  It will be removed in Phase 3 once all peers report _schema_version >= 2.

Other invariants:
- View names are non-empty, max 30 chars, trimmed, unique, not reserved.
- Duplicate session keys within a view are deduplicated by
  `enforce_mutual_exclusion`.

# Destructive-write backstop (settings clobber incident, 2026-07)
#
# Real incident: `views` is replaced WHOLESALE by both settings write paths
# (PATCH /api/settings and federation sync). A client holding a stale
# in-memory copy of `views` -- a browser tab, a phone PWA, or a federation
# peer with a momentarily-fresher timestamp -- can PATCH/sync that stale
# copy back over the server's current state, destroying view definitions in
# one request. This happened twice: 7 of 8 views destroyed by a stale PWA
# tab, then a fleet-wide collapse to 1 view replicated via federation LWW.
#
# This is a single-sided backstop: it inspects what's ABOUT to be written
# and refuses catastrophic shrinkage, regardless of which writer (API PATCH,
# federation sync, internal code) is responsible and regardless of whether
# that writer's timestamp/precondition logic says the write should proceed.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A write is catastrophic if ANY of these hold. Thresholds are deliberately
# conservative -- a real, intentional bulk deletion (e.g. an operator
# clearing out a handful of views) should also be rare enough that requiring
# `allow_destructive: true` (PATCH-path only; see settings.py) is a
# reasonable speed bump, not a workflow blocker.

            in `known_remote_device_ids` (see below) — callers assemble
            this union before calling.
        pruning_state: local bookkeeping dict of the form
            {"first_missed_at": {key: timestamp}}. Defaults to an empty
            structure if None. Mutated in place.
        grace_seconds: how long a key may be missing before it's pruned.
        now: current time (for testing). Defaults to time.time().
        local_device_id: this instance's own device_id. When provided
            (together to opt in to the positive-knowledge rule below),
            keys owned by this device are always evaluable. When None
            (the default), device ownership is ignored entirely and every
            key is evaluated directly against `live_keys` — this is the
            pre-federation-aware behavior, preserved for callers that
            don't (or can't) supply device/reachability info.
        known_remote_device_ids: device_ids of remote peers whose session
            list is CURRENTLY KNOWN to this instance (e.g. has a fresh
            entry in the federation session cache backing
            `/api/federation/sessions`). Only meaningful when
            `local_device_id` is also provided. Defaults to empty set.

    Returns:
        (settings, pruning_state, settings_changed) — settings_changed is True
        iff any key was actually removed from view.sessions or hidden_sessions.

    Behavior:
      1. For each key in settings.hidden_sessions or any view.sessions,
         first determine whether it is EVALUABLE (see "Positive-knowledge
         rule" below). A key that is not evaluable is treated exactly like
         a live key for bookkeeping purposes — any stale first_missed_at
         clock is cleared — but it is never pruned.
      2. For an evaluable key:
         - If key in live_keys: drop the key from pruning_state["first_missed_at"]
           (it's alive, nothing to prune).
         - If key not in live_keys:
             - If first_missed_at[key] is absent, record now.
             - Else if now - first_missed_at[key] >= grace_seconds, remove the
               key from hidden_sessions and from every view's sessions list;
               drop the bookkeeping entry for it.
             - Else: leave both alone (within grace).
      3. The pruning_state dict is the source of truth for "when did we first
         miss this key" — never check live_keys against pruning_state's keys
         that aren't actually in stored settings (clean up bookkeeping for
         keys that are no longer referenced anywhere).

    Positive-knowledge rule (federation-aware pruning):
      A remote-owned key (`"<device_id>:<name>"` where device_id != our own)
      may only be evaluated for pruning when that owning device's session
      list is CURRENTLY KNOWN to us — i.e. `local_device_id` was supplied
      AND the key's device_id is either `local_device_id` itself or present
      in `known_remote_device_ids`. If the owning device is unreachable, or
      we simply have no current data for it, the key is treated as "unknown,
      not dead": pruning never fires and the first_missed_at clock never
      starts or advances for it — the clock is actively cleared instead, so
      a device that goes offline for a week and then comes back online with
      its sessions intact does not resume a partially-elapsed countdown
      (or worse, get pruned instantly) the moment we regain knowledge of it.
      Legacy bare-name entries (no `device_id:` prefix, `_key_owner_device_id`
      returns None) have no determinable owner at all — they preserve
      today's behavior unconditionally and are always evaluated directly
      against `live_keys`, regardless of `local_device_id`.
      When `local_device_id` is None, this whole rule is bypassed and every
      key is evaluated directly against `live_keys` (full backward
      compatibility with pre-federation-aware callers/tests).
