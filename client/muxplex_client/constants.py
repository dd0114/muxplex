"""Mirrored server constants.

These are convenience mirrors of values defined authoritatively on the
muxplex server (`muxplex.sessions`, `muxplex.terminal_input`). The client
does NOT pre-validate against them -- the server is authoritative and fails
closed; a client-side copy that silently disagreed with the server would be
exactly the drift `AGENTS.md` warns about. They exist so a caller can build a
tool schema enum or a UI without a round trip.

`muxplex/tests/test_client_contract.py` (in the server's own test suite)
asserts each of these equals its server original, converting what would
otherwise be a silent drift hazard into a CI-enforced invariant.
