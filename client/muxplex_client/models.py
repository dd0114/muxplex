"""Response shapes for the muxplex client.

All frozen dataclasses, deliberately not pydantic -- see
../muxplex-client-design.md §8 ("Rejected: pydantic models"): heavy for six
shapes, and actively wrong here, since AGENTS.md requires clients to
tolerate unknown fields. `.get()`-based parsing in `_protocol.py` satisfies
that by construction; a strict model would have to be deliberately loosened
to avoid violating the contract.

Where a `raw` field appears (`ServerState`, `Settings`, `InstanceInfo` -- the
single-object, evolution-likely shapes) it is excluded from `__eq__`/`__hash__`
via `compare=False` so a frozen dataclass carrying a dict stays hashable, and
it is how "clients tolerate unknown fields" becomes usable rather than lossy:
a caller needing a field the model doesn't expose yet can still reach it.
`Session`/`Bell`/etc. are hot-path list items with a stable shape and omit it.
